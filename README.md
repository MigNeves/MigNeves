Hi! My name is Miguel Neves and I am currently a PhD student working at the [Robotics and AI](https://github.com/Robotics-and-AI) research laboratory of the University of Coimbra.  

During my PhD thesis I focused on applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to improve the efficiency and flexibility of human-robot collaboration, especially in collaborative assembly tasks.
